This might seem useless but hear me out. PHP hosting is very cheap sometimes even free. This means that you could create a cluster of bare backends that you could rotate. This can help new proxy startups.

If you are self hosting, I recommend you use [frakenphp](https://github.com/dunglas/frankenphp)
